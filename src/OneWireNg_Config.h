 * GPIO blink reveals as a short, unexpected low-high (or vice versa) state
 * change on the digital data wire. The GPIO blink (resulted of the internal
 * library logic) may occur if both of the following circumstances occur:
 *
 * 1. The driver is configured for parasitically powering slaves via GPIO
 *    bit-banging (possible for non open-drain type of output).
 * 2. The underlying platform can't guarantee input to output GPIO switch with
 *    a desired initial state.
 *
 * To prevent the blink resulted of the above @c CONFIG_BUS_BLINK_PROTECTION
 * may be configured. Undesirable side effect of using this parameter is a short
 * period of time when a direct voltage source is provided directly on the data
 * wire. This is basically unwanted behavior in the open-drain environment
 * (except parasitically powering slave devices in a specific period of time
 * during 1-wire activity). The side effect occurs while switching the data
 * wire GPIO from low to high state via the following 3-steps procedure:
 *
 *  1. Initial low state (GPIO configured as output-low).
 *  2. Hight state (GPIO configured as output-high) - direct voltage source
 *     connected to the bus. This is an additional state provided by @c
 *     CONFIG_BUS_BLINK_PROTECTION parameter.
 *  3. High state visible via pull-up resistor (GPIO configured as input).
 *
 * @note @c CONFIG_BUS_BLINK_PROTECTION may be useful to improve 1-wire
 *     communication on long cables by speeding-up low-to-high transition.
